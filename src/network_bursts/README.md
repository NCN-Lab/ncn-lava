# Network Burst Detection

This folder contains the code to detect network bursts in the neuron spike trains.

Several scenarios were analyzed with different conditions of bursting, for example:
- Channel Burst where 4 spikes occur in a given time window.
- Network burst where 5 or more channels burst in a given time window.
